TODO: Intro? I have no idea how to start this post.

The first question I always get when I mention this fact is

<Crane>"How does one become a grandmaster Tetris player? What does that even mean?"</Crane>

This is a great question, but it's not really what I want to talk about today.
For those curious, I've added [a section at the end](#what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-tetris-grandmaster) explaining it, but reading it isn't actually necessary to understand this post.
Still, it's there for the curious.
If you're already familiar (or simply don't care), go ahead and read on.

## The wellspring of content&nbsp;*does*&nbsp;have a bottom

Fundamentally, the amount of time I want to sink into a game is completely uncorrelated to how long that game is.
Some games properly grab me.
Grab me enough that I'll want to play them through to their conclusion, or perhaps even a bit more.
Others hook me for a bit, but I'll bounce off or fade away before even getting halfway through.
In general, I'll play through a game until I don't want to keep playing anymore, but that point can come at a variety of points in the game's content curve:
- For some, I'll do a few levels, but not get that far
- For the more intense ones, I'll usually beat the "intended ending" of the game
- If I'm still wanting more, I'll start going for the bonus content. Collecting strawberries (Celeste), beating the staff ghost time trials (MarioKart 8 DX), and generally going for "100% completion"
- If I'm still wanting more, I might do a bonus playthrough or two, trying out different builds or strategies (Dark Souls 1, Elden Ring)

But some games.
Some games get their hooks so deep, it is like a curse.[^curse]
What do you do when the game has run out of content to give you, but you *can't leave?*

Eh?

<Crane>Why *Tetris*? Why did this game hold your interest for so long?</Crane>

[^curse]: As with my feelings on [floating point](/articles/floating-point-hashing-addenda#a-lukewarm-defense-of-floating-point), I say this full of admiration. I don't resent this fact, or the games that do it to me. I love them. I love them so much it almost hurts.
