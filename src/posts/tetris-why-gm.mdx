import Crane from '@/components/speechBubble/Crane';

I was at [RustWeek](https://rustweek.org/) recently, and during the speaker intro, the emcee mentioned that I'm a Grandmaster Tetris player.
This [is true](https://theabsolute.plus/score/13277)[^gm], and it's my default fun-fact whenever people like conference organizers want to know interesting bullet points about me for emcees to read.

The first question I always get when I mention this fact is:

<Crane>"How does one become a Grandmaster Tetris player? What does that even mean?"</Crane>

This is a great question, but it's not really what I want to talk about today.
For those curious, I've added [a section at the end](#what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-tetris-grandmaster) explaining it, but reading it isn't actually necessary to understand this post.
Still, it's there for the curious.
If you're already familiar (or simply don't care), go ahead and read on.

Regardless, later that week, I was hanging out with my good friend and coworker, [Miles Silberling-Cook](https://internet.place/).
Miles asked me a much more interesting question.

<Crane>"Why? What drove you to become a Grandmaster in Tetris?"[^paraphrased]</Crane>

And I've been thinking about it.

## The wellspring of content&nbsp;*does*&nbsp;have a bottom

Fundamentally, the amount of time I want to sink into a game is completely uncorrelated to how long that game is.
In general, I'll play through a game until I don't want to keep playing anymore, but that point can come at a variety of points in the game's content curve:
- For some, I'll bounce off or fade away before finishing the main story
- Some grab me properly, and I'll play them out to their "intended ending", then stop
- If I'm still wanting more, I'll start going for the bonus content. Collecting strawberries ([Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game))), beating the staff ghost time trials ([MarioKart 8 DX](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe)), and generally going for "100% completion"
- If I'm still wanting more, I might do a bonus playthrough or two, trying out different builds or strategies ([Dark Souls 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls), [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring))

But some games.
Some games get their hooks so deep, it is like a curse.[^curse]
What do you do when you've done every bonus level, found every collectible, beaten every challenge...
What do you do when the game has run out of content to give you, but you *can't leave?*

## Behind the curtain

When you've already done everything there is to do within the **designed space** of the game (or simply aren't interested in what remains in that space), it's time peek behind the curtain and start playing outside the designed area.

- A bit of explanation about the designed space vs the area outside it
- Out here, you need to make your own structure
- There's some weird shit back here
- We're not the first, or the last, to encounter this:
	- Speedrunners
	- Challenge runs
	- The ABC
	- Scientific study

## ~Why Tetris?

<Crane>But why?</Crane>

Eh?

<Crane>Why *Tetris*? Why did this game hold your interest for so long?</Crane>

## What does it mean to be a Tetris Grandmaster?

- I play a series of brutally difficult single-player Tetris games called *Tetris: The Grandmaster*
- In these games, you get a grade or ranking depending on how well you do
- The highest possible rank is the Grandmaster rank, which I have in TGM 1
- The series gets harder as it goes on. There are somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000 TGM 1 Grandmasters (estimates vary)
- The second game, TAP, has somewhere between 100 and 500 (estimates vary). My rank in TAP is S9, two ranks below GM.
- The third game, TI, has 26. I do not play TI
- The fourth and most recent game, AE, has 2. I do play AE, but I haven't put any serious effort into the master mode yet.

[^gm]: You'll notice that the grade section says "GM", which indicates a Grandmaster. You can check out my profile on that site for my other Tetris achievements, which I try to keep up-to-date.
[^paraphrased]: Paraphrased.
[^curse]: As with my feelings on [floating point](/articles/floating-point-hashing-addenda#a-lukewarm-defense-of-floating-point), I say this full of admiration. I don't resent this fact, or the games that do it to me. I love them. I love them so much it almost hurts.
