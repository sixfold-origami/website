My biofamily has a video call each Sunday to catch up with each other and keep in touch.
We started it during the pandemic, but we've kept it going the past five years.
On our most recent call, my father mentioned an interesting idea he had: what if you built a scale model of the solar system, with the [Las Vegas Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(venue))[^sphere] standing in for the Sun?

	alt="An image of the Sphere in Las Vegas. It is larger than all the nearby buildings, but not so large that it blocks the whole skyline. A whale is shown on its LED surface."

Sphere has a diameter of 157 meters, though the bottom third is "sunk" into the ground, resulting in a total height of only 112 meters.
This is quite large, especially in width, but still shorter than the tallest resort hotels in Las Vegas. 

TODO: Graph of buildings

Sticking the sun in its place[^not-recommended] results in a solar system model roughly 8.8 million times smaller than the real deal[^scale-factor].
As we start walking away from the Sphere, each of our strides carries us about 6.2km through space.
That translates to an effective speed of roughly 44 million kilometers per hour, or [0.04c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).

[^sphere]: Apparently the official name is just *Sphere*. In the original conversation, that's what my father called it, to which my brother responded: "There are a lot of spheres in the world, dad"
[^not-recommended]: I do not recommend doing this.
[^scale-factor]: The exact scale factor I used for my calculations was 1.12836e-7. If someone writes to me complaining about the [float precision](/articles/floating-point-hashing-addenda) of the calculator I used, I swear I *will* turn this blog around.
