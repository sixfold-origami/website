My biofamily has a video call each Sunday to catch up with each other and keep in touch.
We started it during the pandemic, but we've kept it going for the past five years.
On our most recent call, my father mentioned an interesting idea he had: what if you built a scale model of the solar system, with the [Las Vegas Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(venue))[^sphere] standing in for the Sun?

Sphere has a diameter of 157 meters, though the bottom third is "sunk" into the ground, resulting in a total height of only 112 meters.
This is quite large, especially in width, but still shorter than the tallest resort hotels in Las Vegas. 

TODO: Graph of buildings

Sticking the sun in its place[^not-recommended] results in a solar system model roughly 8.8 million times smaller than the real deal[^scale-factor].
As we start walking away from the Sphere, each of our strides carries us about 6.2km through space.
That translates to an effective speed of roughly 44 million kilometers per hour, or [0.04c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).

Even at this blistering speed, it's still going to be a long walk to our first destination.

## The Courier

Walking south down the Las Vegas strip, we pass all the extravagant sights that I've heard about in movies but never actually seen.
We pass casinos, the tiny Eiffel tower, and all the other glorious monuments to glorious overindulgence.
After 90 minutes of walking, we reach the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" sign at the start of the strip. 
We've traveled about 4.5 kilometers of earth space, and 40 million kiometers of solar system space.
We still haven't reached Mercury.

The strip really just... ends after the sign.

After passing the sign, all the glorious sights just kinda drop away.
To our left is the [Harry Reid International Airport](https://www.harryreidairport.com/).
To our right is a largely unobstructed view of the Mojave.
Is it strange that I find it prettier than the strip?[^strip]

After walking for another half hour, we finally reach our destination.
6.6 kilometers from the Sphere is a tiny parking lot with a Starbucks and a Chick-fil-a.

Mercury is chilling at the Starbucks table, enjoying a coffee.
At this scale, Mercury is only about 55 centimeters in diameter.
That's about the width of a standard desktop computer monitor.
You could probably fit Mercury in your refrigerator, if it were empty.
Mercury is just about the perfect size for hugging.
The Sun is on the scale of skyscrapers, and our little courier is small enough to hold in your hands.
And it's so far away, that even walking at a measurable fraction of the speed of light, it still took us 2 hours to get there.

The solar system is big, man.

<Crane>Can we swap to a faster mode of travel before we head to Venus? This is taking forever.</Crane>

Good idea.

## The Evening Star

Hopping in the car, it only takes us about 12 minutes to drive back to the Sphere at the north end of the strip.
Our average earth speed is about 44 kph (27mph), which puts our solar system speed at 392 million kph, or roughly [0.36c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).[^physics]

After that quick jaunt, we hop on I-15 North and drive for 14 minutes to reach Venus.
We're on the highway, but our average speed on this section is only about 63 kph (39 mph).
Isn't traffic fun?

Here, 12.2km from the Sphere, the highway crosses over the [Las Vegas Wash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Wash), a manmade stream that drains the city's excess water into [Lake Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mead).
The concrete trough that makes up the stream is about 20m (66ft) wide.
Venus, only about 1.36m (4ft 6in) in diameter could roll down the middle with room to spare.
Venus is about as wide as a loveseat.

If Venus actually were rolling down the stream, it would be rolling very slowly, only about 4mm every second.

<Crane>That's slower than a snail!</Crane>

By a lot too!
Snails move at about 0.03mph, or about 13mm per second.

That's right, it's us ♥

## TODO

Distance is measured as the crow flies, but the travel times are based on google maps routes.
Planetary orbits are actually eccentric!
How fast are the planets actually moving?

accelerate to 70 mph, or roughly 112 kph.[^canadian-miles]
Our solar system speed ramps up to 998 million kph, or roughly [0.93c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).

[^sphere]: Apparently the official name is just *Sphere*. In the original conversation, that's what my father called it, to which my brother responded: "There are a lot of spheres in the world, dad"
[^not-recommended]: I do not recommend doing this.
[^scale-factor]: The exact scale factor I used for my calculations was 1.12836e-7. If someone writes to me complaining about the [float precision](/articles/floating-point-hashing-addenda) of the calculator I used, I swear I *will* turn this blog around.
[^strip]: Well, if streetview is to be believed. Maybe it's more dazzling in person.
[^physics]: To keep the scope of this post relatively manageable, we're going to be ignoring the relativistic effects of going this fast. And also because I don't know enough physics to say what the relativistic effects would be.
[^canadian-miles]: I'm trying to run everything in metric here, but the US interstate system is determined to ruin my blog post specifically. Also yes I know that the speed limit isn't 70 through the whole interstate, but running the numbers this way is simpler.
