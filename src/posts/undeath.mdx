I've been thinking about emotional resiliency a lot recently.

As a programmer, your emotional resiliency is tested frequently.
Mysterious program failures, inscrutable compiler errors, unpleasant debugging systems, unclear documentation, and so on, all of which run with the undercurrent that, in theory, all your program's shortcomings are ultimately *your fault*, somehow.

In this field, you need to be able to work through things like this.
All fields have their struggles, of course, but this pain is the pain I know best.
And in tech, some of the suffering is simply baked into the loaf.
It is *inherent*.[^suffering]
Part of the reason they pay you the big bucks is *because* you suffer through it.

## Archetypes of Resilience

<Crane>
	"I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and more. Still, I'm lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven't." -The Last Stag, Hollow Knight
</Crane>

Different prople approach this in different ways.
Sometimes, radically different strategies are optimal for different brains.
Recently, I've been thinking about these in terms **archetypes**, calling towards the concepts of character archetypes that you see in creative writing. I've identified a few of these:

- Artisans
- Gardeners
- Angels of Retribution
- Bridge Four
- Mamma Bears

This is by no means a complete list, and It's also very possible (and, in fact, likely) that a single person could fit into multiple of these.
The point is that having words to identify patterns of resiliency can help us to see these things in ourselves, and in others.[^archetypes]

But when I think of myself, and how I manage the unending struggle of existance, I am not any of these.
I am **Undead**.

## Bearer of the Curse[^seek]

This is a more personal post than I usually write.
If you know me through my work, this may be more emotionally vulnerable than you are used to in a professional setting.
If you wish, you may choose to interpret this post as Practical Advice About Getting Shit Done<sup>TM</sup>, instead of an emotional diatribe about mental health in general.

The choice is yours.
Regardless, the words will continue.

## One day, they'll knock me down for good

## ..

I do not remember exactly when the cursemark first appeared on my flesh.
Perhaps I was born with it, but I do not think so.
Mine is in the traditional location: on my back, just covering my right shoulder blade.

As a result of it, I cannot die.
They can knock me down as hard as they like, but the next morning, I just wake back up again.

	"Yet and undead who would die for something has nothing to fear, for death simply becomes a stepping stone to his goal." -VaatiVidya
</Crane>

<Crane>
	"If you fall down seven times, stand up eight. That's the cry of the undead. It's not a matter of life or death; it's about what breaks first: your will or the barriers in your way." -VaatiVidya

[^suffering]: To be clear, this is not to imply that all of the suffering is inherent to the domain, or that we can not or should not seek to improve our tooling and practices to reduce the suffering. Doing so is both good and important! My point is simply that the suffering will never get down to zero. The world is just too complex and flawed for that.
[^archetypes]: I may write posts about all of these at some point, but it will be challenging, as I am not most of them. But, here is the shortest version ever: Artisans take pride in the quality of the things they produce, Gardeners tend their collection of plants with small nudges to encourage the best outcomes, [Angels of Retribution](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/) channel their anger and rage into making things better, Bridge Four gets strength from going through hard things with their collection of friends, and Mamma Bears do it to protect their children.
[^seek]: Seek seek lest.
